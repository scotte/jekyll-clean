Sea Turtles

Sea turtles are one of the most endangered species in the world. 
Huge afforts have been made within the last decade to increase the lifespan of sea turtles. 
Most sea turtles die within the first couple years of being born from sea debris, human activity, and predators.

We can help sea turtle populations by being aware of human activities. Sea turtles nest on beaches which means keeping
their nests free from debris and left alone will create a more smooth transition from land to water when
the eggs hatch.
